**Is your data structure request related to a computational problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. For example, I am working on a new dictionary implementation and I'd like the internal functionality to be based on a BTree implementation.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. For example:

> I'd like to have a generic BTree implementation where I can specify the types of the keys and values, so that I can define a higher-level interface for a dictionary based on that.

Or, more concretely:

> I'd like to have an implementation of the BTree Data Structure, based on the following research paper: [Organization and Maintenance of Large Ordered Indexes - Bayer & McCreight](https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
