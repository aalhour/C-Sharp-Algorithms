# C# ALGORITHMS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aalhour/C-Sharp-Algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aalhour/C-Sharp-Algorithms)

A C# plug-and-play class-library project of standard Data Structures and Algorithms. It contains 35+ Data Structures and 30+ Algorithms designed as Object-Oriented isolated components. Even though this project started for educational purposes, the implemented Data Structures and Algorithms are standard, efficient, stable and tested.

## DESCRIPTION

This project originally started out as an interview preparation project. However, after receiving a great amount of positive responses on [reddit](https://redd.it/3etf9f), and noticing excitement from a few [GitHubers](https://github.com/aalhour/C-Sharp-Algorithms/graphs/contributors) to contribute furthermore to it, the project took on a different meaning. So, I decided to keep maintaining it as a reference for data structures and algorithm implementations in C# as well as my own research side-project under these topics.

#### Solution Hierarchy:

This is a C#.NET solution-project, and it contains three subprojects:

  1. [Algorithms](Algorithms): A class library project. Contains the Algorithms implementations.
  2. [Data Structures](DataStructures): A class library project. Contains the Data Structures implementations.
  3. [Main Program](MainProgram): Contains tests for the data structures and algorithms projects.

#### Requirements:
  1. C# 5
  2. .NET 4.5
  3. NUnit 

#### A Note to Contributors:
If you wish to contribute to C# ALGORITHMS, then please make sure you check out the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

Note: The projects where tested on Xamarin Studio (MonoDevelop) on OSX 10, and Visual Studio on Windows 7.
